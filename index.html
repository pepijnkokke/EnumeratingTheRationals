            Enumerating The Rationals
          </h1>
          <p>
            In this repository I present a formalization of the functional pearl
            <a href=
            "http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/jeremy.gibbons/publications/rationals.pdf">
            "Enumerating the Rationals"</a> by Gibbons, Lester and Bird in Coq.
          </p>
          <p>
            My approach is divided into two parts:
          </p>
          <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
            <li>implement the primitives for reasoning about codata;
            </li>
            <li>implement the enumerations discussed in the paper.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Each module is implemented in literal Coq, and contains further
            documentation.
          </p>
          <h2 class="section" id="data-and-codata">
            Data and CoData
          </h2>
          <p>
            There aren't many theories regarding CoData (or CoInductives) in Coq's
            standard library. Because of this, I've implemented several structures
            myself. These packages can be found in the <code>CoData</code> directory.
          </p>
          <p>
            First of all, I've implemented a library for reaoning about CoLists,
            based on Coq's Stream datatype. I've adapted the names to match better
            with the similar constructs for lists, and implemented several theories
            regarding membership, concatination and the relation with finite lists.
            For more on CoLists see <a href="doc/CoList.html">the CoList module</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Secondly, I've implemented a library for reaoning about CoTrees. This
            libary was written from the ground up, and includes many of the same
            structures as the CoList module. Aside from this, it also includes
            several theories that will be especially usefull when implementing the
            enumerations from the paper, such as breath-first traversal. For more on
            CoTrees see <a href="doc/CoTree.html">the CoTree module</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lastly, I've implemented a small extension over the standard List module,
            which can be found in the <code>Data</code> directory. For more on this,
            see <a href="doc/List.html">the List module</a>.

            The Naive Tree
          </h2>
          <p>
            Our very first attempt is not discussed in the paper, but was written to
            test the <code>CoTree</code> module. It describes a tree of rational
            numbers, where branching to the left means an increase in numerator and
            branching to the right means an increase in the denominator.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is simple to see that this tree contains all rational numbers, and it
            in fact many, many duplicates.
          </p>
          <p>
            While we had little trouble construcing this tree, and subsequently in
            deconstructing it to an enumeration, it already proved quite hard to
            prove some simple properties with regard to this tree.
          </p>
          <p>

            module</a>.

            The Naive Enumeration
          </h2>
          <p>
            The first formalisation of an algorithm disussed in the paper involves
            deforesting the matrix in which, much as in the previous approach, moving
            to the next column increases the numerator and moving to the next row
            increases the denominator.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is simple to see that this matrix contains all rational numbers, but
            the problem here is that it still contains pairs of rationals that reduce
            to one another.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have adapted the algorithm that generates the deforested matrix
            directly, but this already proved quite the challenge, and it involves a
            concatination of a colist of lists, which is only possible if we know for
            certain that eventually we will encounter a nonempty list.
          </p>

            The Stern-Brocot Tree
          </h2>
          <p>
            The second formalisation involves deforesting the Stern-Brocot tree,
            which exploits the relation between the execution trace of Eulid's GCD
            algorithm and its usage in the reduction of rational numbers.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have adapted the algorithm that generates the tree using a stepper
            function, and have attempted to prove several properties with regard to
            this implementation. Furthermore, we have implemented a GCD function that
            records its trace, and have attempted to prove several claims made in the
            paper with regards to this algorithm.
          </p>

            The Calkin-Wilf Tree

          <p>
            The last formalisation involves a direct construction of the Calkin-Wilf
            tree. Though we haven't had the time to prove much with regards to this
            tree, it's construction was too simple not to include.
