  (* We have to somehow prove a duality between [next] and [findp],
     where in [next] if [n] increases we consume a [Left] path, if [d]
     increases we consume a [Right] path, and in [findp] we generate
     a [Left] path as long as we can consume successors of [n], and 
     [Right] paths as long as we can consume successors of [d]. *)

  Proof.
